working on computer vision in my spare time

this is a compilation of coding that I'm putting together on my journey through computer vision. I had started this a while ago but my computer couldn't run the video captures without overheating. 

The initial struggle with downloading packages on a windows platform is making sure the paths are setup correctly and we're able to import the right packages, there were a lot of different ways to do this but I stumbled across a simple video to be able to get it setup correctly for Visual Studio Code. 

I used this video to help me with setting it up and installing it:

So after going through and making sure it was installed correctly I ran into an issue where the imshow function was not showing the image as expected on Visual Studio Code. After a lot of researching and going through stackoverflow I managed to find this link https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49992300/how-to-show-graph-in-visual-studio-code-itself
which helped me be able to get the image to show when running the program in Visual Studio Code using Jupyter extension.

Here is how my screen looks after setting it up:

The code shown there was part of the official opencv github for deep neural networks on openpose.
